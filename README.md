A list of safe-to-use Obsidian Community Plugins.

Every plugin listed here have had its code thoroughly reviewed by me, considering:
* **Safety** — does not access sensitive information, nor contains suspicious code that may enable future exploits

* **Purpose** — strictly adheres to the expected functionality, as described in its description
